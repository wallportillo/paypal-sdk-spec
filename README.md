# PayPal SDK Spec

Public specification and location for RFCs for the PayPal SDK

## Goals

The goals of this specification are:

- Provide a unified specification for the PayPal SDKs on all platforms
- Provide a set of standards which should be followed by the public interface for the SDKs
- Provide a mechanism for RFCs to be made to update the SDK public interface
- Facilitate discussion around all of the above

## Out Of Scope

The following are considered out of scope for this specification:

- Any implementation details which do not affect the public interface of the SDKs
- Integration guides or tutorials

## Contents

- [Standards](./spec/standards/README.md)
- [Client SDKs](./spec/client/README.md)
- [Server SDKs](./spec/server/README.md)

## Tags

- `__TODO__`: Placeholder for an interface which needs to be fully specced out.
- `__DEPRECATED__`: Deprecated interface which should be removed fully in the next major release.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
